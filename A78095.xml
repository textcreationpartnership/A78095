            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>A Book without a Preface, is like a Houſe without an Entry, in Complement therefore to ancient Cuſtom, I prefix the one to the other, being too apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the preſidents or precepts of old dictators.</p>
            <p>I was a painful drudge for above ten years in the old method of Phyſick, and am almoſt aſham'd to mention how I ſpent time in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting (as I thought for future benefit) the choiceſt of their Wares; inſomuch that I can furniſh my Patients for a year or two with Waſte-Paper. For I thought it a ſin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the abilities of our Fore-fathers. But my life not terminating with thoſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor ſo much as an itch of knowledge cur'd by their old methods; I have paſs'd the laſt eight or ten years of my life in peruſing the
<pb facs="tcp:170746:3"/> improvements of latter Times, and in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to practice what of 'em I could convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtill aiming at more. For, I think, <hi>great Improvements may be made, eſpecially in the Practick part of our Profeſſion; and conſequently our Art rendred much more ſerviceable, and all this with very great caſe, if Phyſicians wou'd each apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more particularly to the Study and Practice of ſome one Diſeaſe, and ſelect and refine appropriate Remedies:</hi> For then they cou'd not but arrive to a higher pitch of knowledge in one thing than ſo many; and ſo avoid the reproach of being <hi>aliquid in omnibus &amp; nihil in ſingulis.</hi> 'Tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that when Perſons have thus imploy'd themſelves, they have been more fortunate than others. Dr. <hi>Turbervil</hi> has done more to the Eyes than others could perform. Dr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> is more Skilful in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of Women than others, and ſo I could inſtance in-ſeveral. Not but that moſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are as great Maſters in Anatomy, and as general Scholars as theſe worthy Perſons;
<pb facs="tcp:170746:3"/> (I hope I may ſay it without offence) but they have apply'd themſelves more to the Study and Practice of what they particularly profeſs, and ſo cannot but Excel. 'Tis not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that any Perſon can retain the Names, much leſs the Knowledge of thoſe innumerable Diſeaſes, Authors have been pleas'd to aſſign to humane Body: How then can he be furniſh't with apt and proper Methods for 'em all? I know 'tis an eaſie thing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a <hi>R.</hi> and leave it to it's chance.</p>
            <p>But I appeal to every Intelligent Perſon whether theſe my propoſals, (without enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating a thouſand Reaſons, or comparing with the variety of Merchants and other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys) are not Conſiderable; at leaſt ſo as to Excuſe me for undertaking a particular Diſtemper to exerciſe my Induſtry upon. And if this is allow'd, I am only then to excuſe my Self for pitching on the Diſeaſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I account my Self oblig'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſomething of difficulty, that it may be ſeen I propoſe not Eaſe, but Labour: And
<pb facs="tcp:170746:4"/> to endeavour to ſatisfie the World that no Diſeaſe need ſtrike ſo ſure a ſtroak as Death, but may be dealt with by the Rules of Art, and brought under: and that tho' many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes look Tyrannizing, yet great relief may be given by the improvement of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. For I hardly think but God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſuitable Remedies to moſt Maladies: Only has left it to the Study of Man to ſearch 'em out and apply 'em.</p>
            <p>But I have yet greater Reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Diſtemper, for it being the Diſeaſe of my own Conſtitution; <hi>I have for ſeveral Years made it my extraordinary Study: And beſides my own improvements, I have by Communication had the help of others, particularly of a late Undertaker.</hi> The knowledge of whoſe Method and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines coſt me too dear: But I'll ſpare his Name, for that I was not fairly dealt with.</p>
            <p>I am not in the following Diſcourſe at a compleat or Methodical account of my work: tho' I am pretty well furniſh'd for both; having wrought hard in my <hi>Laboratory</hi> to perfect
<pb facs="tcp:170746:4"/> Medicines; and been at ſome pains to order their diſpenſation, not Empirically, but Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and depending on ſolid Rules of Theory, But I'le not here prevent my ſelf; nor in the ſhape of a Pamphlet deſcribe any Lineaments of my new Deſign, hoping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its diſcovery intirely to my ſelf, till I ſhall have adorn'd it with ſome Select Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neceſſary to qualify it for a general View. And 'tis fit to confine this Portal to ſome proportion, conſidering the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micil to which it is an Inroad.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE OF CONSUMPTIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEing about to Treat of an old Caſe in a new Way, I ſhall deſert all Ancient Writers, and their unaccountable Labyrinths of perplext Terms of Art; and tell my Deſign in plain Engliſh. For I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffect not Words, but Senſe; not hard Names for Diſeaſes, but their Cure.</p>
            <p>I have for ſome Years laſt paſt undertaken the Cure of <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> by a New Method of Refin'd Medicines, and with ſuch encouragement from ſucceſs, that I'm embolden'd to give only this ſhort account publickly. Partly by way of Tryal, the better to uſher in my Select new <hi>Praxis</hi> of this Diſeaſe, together with an agreeable <hi>Theory,</hi> that I may reconcile both to the good opinion of Ingenious Perſons. And becauſe Prudence beſpeaks my preſent ſecrecy, for that I have expended not only Labour and Time, but Stock too in carrying on Operations
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170746:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> in my Laboratory, for perfecting this work, I muſt therefore beg Favour that Charity may begin and reſide a little at Home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſumptions</hi> have been always accounted, tho' an Eaſie, yet ſure way to the Shades below or Regions above. Phyſicians therefore generally chuſe an Air for ſuch, or rather adviſe 'em thereby to withdraw from Men and Buſineſs, to attend their Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly departure. But my preſent Deſign is to give ſuch an account or <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> as may demonſtrate 'em not only capable of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but Cur'd too, (if not too late attempted) as well as other Diſtempers; without lying under an Indiſpenſable Fate as ſoon as ever the Diſeaſe is apprehended to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Phthiſis (a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> deficio, Corrumpo)</hi> or <hi>Tabes</hi> in Latin, ſignifies in general the Extenuation and Leanneſs of the Body, from whatſoever Cauſe. But by many Phyſicians of late 'tis taken for that decay of Fleſh which is caus'd by an inward Fret of Blood, or ſlow <hi>Feaver</hi> that Exulcerates and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Some will have it to be purely an Exulceration of the Lungs, others will have it to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration of the Lungs from a ſharp Croding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſtirring up a Cough from a ſlow Hectick Feaver, by which is diſcharged purulent, viſcous, foul ſpitting, that extenuate and conſume the whole Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> by the Ancient Followers of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> have been thought the Diſeaſes of the Lungs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170746:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> only, becauſe they are apt to be Tainted in thoſe Diſtempers, and ſoon ſhew themſelves diſaffected. But 'tis with them as with the other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their different uſes aſſign'd 'em by Nature. They may by an <hi>Intemperies,</hi> obſtruction by a charge of ſharp <hi>Serum</hi> from an ill <hi>Craſis</hi> of Blood, Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of Humours, or the like, contract thoſe ill Juices which ulcerate, and ſo make a decay of that part. And theſe Ulcerous Humours thus depos'd by the Blood, for want of due diſcharge, ſoon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſy and taint the Maſs of Blood again by a Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal injury. But that general <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> here treated of, has its Original Cauſe from Deprav'd Vitiated Blood, which begets an univerſal <hi>Atrophy,</hi> waſting and Leanneſs (even to the drought of a <hi>Skeleton</hi> with ſome) with which 'tis always accompanied. And the Blood thus Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt converts the Chyle into ill Juices, performing but imperfect Sanguification; ſo the whole Maſs becomes degenerate and deveſted of its true Lamp of Life, and due proportion of its active Principle, whence ariſe many Diſtempers too tedious here to Recount, which not timely regarded terminate in <hi>Conſumptions.</hi> And the Lungs ſoon receive damage from foul Blood by reaſon of the Laxneſs and Spongineſs of the <hi>Parenchy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if by this violent Motion it cannot be thus diſcharg'd, but the adheſion is too cloſe, and not Ripen'd for it, by glibbing with Medicine the <hi>Ductus's</hi> of the Windpipe, then long continuing on theſe parts (it being deveſted of the active living Principles, Balſom of Life, and repeated Circulations) renders it Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid and a Nautious Load, and very apt to Taint and Ulcerate the pure Subſtance of the Lungs, by their Natural Texture inclinable to ſuch decay. And when once the Blood has thus found a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge upon the Lungs, it continues as it paſſes by in its Circulation, to throw off its ſharp Scor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And being thus willing to deceive themſelves, they look on Robuſt Perſons, who do weather out a Cough it may be a whole Winter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them for Examples, Ruin their tenderer Conſtitutions in the mean while.</p>
            <p>Some get this Diſeaſe by <hi>Infection,</hi> which has been frequently obſerved from the Marriage of a Conſumptive Body, that has decay'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its well conſtituted Companion, and liv'd many Years beyond all probability on its Ruins.</p>
            <p>Very Lean and Old Bodies have large hungry Pores, which Magnetically attract all that's <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive</hi> about 'em. The witherings of Age are often Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The <hi>Scurvey,</hi> when arriv'd to any height, as to beget Feaveriſh intermiſſions of the Blood, which I call a <hi>Scorbutick Feaver,</hi> and is nicely to be diſtinguiſht from an incipient <hi>Conſumption,</hi> does often terminate in this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtant uſe of Wines, Spirits or Drams, and other Strong Liquors,</hi> though in ſmall quantities at a time, are very injurious to young Perſons whoſe Blood is too apt to Fire and enkindle into Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The early Marriages,</hi> much more the <hi>Exorbitant uſe of Venus,</hi> which is uſually committed in Heats of Drink, couſequently without government, are deſtroyers of Nature, and preambulary to this Diſeaſe.

And we have as much reaſon to forewarn People hereof, (if we mean 'em well) as Divines have to caution 'em againſt little Sins; and ſtrictly to obſerve and regard the firſt inſtances of change from Goodneſs; for as a little ill habit of Body is nicely to be diſtinguiſh'd from an ordinary good Temper, ſo deprav'dneſs of mind, through the cuſtom of little ſins only, ſizes ſo exactly with the common <hi>Genius</hi> of the World, that it ſeems like none at all to many Perſons; nevertheleſs both Body and Soul are in the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But you never ſee Wealthy or careful Perſons thus afflicted: 'tis fit therefore for Perſons to have recourſe to the Learned in Phyſick, (if Health and Life be valuable) to take ſometime a true eſtimate of their preſent Conſtitutions, eſpecially if doubtful in any reſpect: Hereby many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are prevented, and thoſe <hi>Sordes</hi> amaſs'd in the Body for Diſcharge (which are the Fewel of moſt Diſtempers) are timely expell'd, ſo that no imminent danger can enſue.</p>
            <p>By our preventive Method for <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> many that have juſt begun to decline and waſte in their Fleſh, ſeiz'd on by this depopulating Diſeaſe, have had a Renovation of all the juices of their Bodies: By ſweetning their Blood, plump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fleſh, and removing all bad Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; for though Perſons are naturally inclin'd to <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> yet by the uſe of this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive Method, or ſome ſuch like, together with the Addition of their own care in wholſome rules for Life, they may both avoid this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and protract their Lives to great length. And I know not why as great Relief to Sickly diſcompos'd Bodies may not be expected from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as our common recruits to nature from Food, were but the former as ſeaſonably and ſuitably apply'd as this latter: For I doubt not but the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170746:12"/> Wiſe Creator ſuffers all things in this World to perform their Natural Energy and Force, that right Meaſures may be taken by Rational Creatures, Lords of the Creation, in Refining, Uſing and diſpenſing Natures Rarities: And from that equal Proviſion made for Diſeas'd as well as healthy Bodies in the great variety of Plants, Minerals, and living Creatures, we may obſerve the Providence of God in ordering means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Health that's decaying, as well as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in Vigour: Nay the curious Texture of the particles of Plants and Minerals in their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, Cathartick, Sudorifick, Diuretick,</hi> &amp;c. qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, ſhews in part the Delicacy, Difficulty and Excellency of a Phyſicians Skill. Now if theſe things neceſſary for Life, may be well us'd or miſapply'd, they are the wiſeſt Perſons who by the conduct of their Reaſons ſo proportion 'em to their Appetites, that there may be neither Defect on the one hand, nor Exceſs on the other: But becauſe this exact performance to ſome is a burthenſome nicety, and a Methodical Life to others is worſe than Death, ſuch may at leaſt commit this piece of prudence, as at ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable times to enquire into their Conſtitutions; and if they have indulg'd too much in Meat, Drink, or other Pleaſures, procure ſuch early help as may eaſily exterminate the ſeeds of many Diſeaſes, and thus prevent tedious and hazardous Fits of Sickneſs: But I chiefly deſign to perſwade Perſons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170746:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> timely to prevent or amend the tendency of their Bodies to <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> which by Coughs, waſting of their Fleſh, dryneſs and heats in the Palms of their hands, and Soles of their Feet, by fluſhing in the Face, Night-ſweats, &amp;c. are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.

And 'tis a piece of Curioſity and Skill in our profeſſion to diſcern what Coughs do preſage a deep <hi>Conſumption,</hi> and what are to be dealt with in a common Method, and the defect of this early Scrutiny has ruin'd thouſands by irrecoverable <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> which might have been prevented.

And we chuſe rather to obſerve Urines in the beginnings of this Diſeaſe, than when it has made a ſetled decay of the Body. Urines rightly examin'd, give as true an account of the Conſtitution of the Blood, as the Wax does the impreſſion of the Seal: But we muſt have the Urine that's made the latter part of the Night, where 'tis diſcharg'd more than once, for by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Circulations of the <hi>Serum</hi> with the Maſs of Blood, and its longer digeſtion, it does ſo imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
